# Project_2

## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to analyze data surrounding the movie industry (film releases, budgets, domestic & foreign revenue, etc.) in order to determine what aspects are vital to creating a successful movie studio. First, I began with importing and cleaning all of the data. After cleaning the data, I sorted through it in order to compose the necessary questions that need to be answered. Once that is done, I can run through my process and give recommendations based on my results.  

## The Data
The data for this project was distributed by Flatiron School, and have been gathered below. All tables have been cleaned, however not all of the data was used in the final analysis.
- Box Office Mojo: https://www.boxofficemojo.com
- IMDB: https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/
- Rotten Tomatoes: https://www.rottentomatoes.com
- The Movie Database: https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US

## Objective
Sift through the data in order to determine the necessary components of creating a movie studio.
Determine what genres are most successful - production budget, worldwide gross revenue, return on investment
Determine what studios are most successful - director, genre, roi, actors, writers
Does a high rating correlate to a successful film?
